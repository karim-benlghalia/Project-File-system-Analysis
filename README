File System Interpreter and constancy Analysis:
Part1 (in C language): Designed and tested a program to analyze the file system and output a summary to a CSV file (describing the super block, groups, free-lists, Inodes, indirect blocks, and directories).
Part2 (in Python): Designed a program that analyzes the CSV file produced in part 1 and reports on all discovered inconsistencies.


Makefile:
	default:
		Build the lab3.py to produce an executable named lab3b.
	dist:
		Create the deliverable tarball
	clena:
		Delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile, and return the directory to its frechly un-tar-ed state.
lab3b.py:
	Python program which analyze a file system summary and report on all discovered inconsistencies.
	1.Block Consistency Audits: It will look all the block pointer, and if the block pointer is invalid it will print the error message with specifi format.
	2.I-node Allocation Audits: Scan through all of the I-nodes to determine which are valid/allocated
	3.Directory Consistency Audits: Scan all of the directories to enumerate all links
