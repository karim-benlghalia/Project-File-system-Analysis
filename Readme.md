# File System Interpreter and constancy Analysis:
* Part1 (in C language): Program to analyze the file system and output a summary to a CSV file 
(describing the super block, groups, free-lists, Inodes, indirect blocks, and directories).
* Part2 (in Python): Program that analyzes the CSV file produced in part 1 and reports on all discovered inconsistencies.


* Makefile:
	* default:
		Build the lab3.py to produce an executable named lab3b.
	* dist:
		Create the deliverable tarball
	* clena:
		Delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile, and return the directory to its frechly un-tar-ed state.
* lab3b.py:
	Python program which analyze a file system summary and report on all discovered inconsistencies.
	1. Block Consistency Audits: It will look all the block pointer, and if the block pointer is 
	invalid it will print the error message with specifi format.
	2. I-node Allocation Audits: Scan through all of the I-nodes to determine which are valid/allocated
	3. Directory Consistency Audits: Scan all of the directories to enumerate all links
* lab3a-final.c: Program to analyze the file system and output a summary to a CSV file
	       This project more deeply explores the filesystem structures described in Arpaci chapter 39.
	       The images we will be working with are EXT2 file systems, as described in sections 40.2-40.5.
